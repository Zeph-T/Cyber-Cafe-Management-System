{\large \bf ABSTRACT}
\end{center}  

This project is based on the working of Cyber Cafe Management activity which is
involved in allotting various types of Management like keep the record of registered
User and non registered user, updating the records. And deleting the records and
also to generate their reports. The cyber cafe current maintains the records manually.
All the working hours, user name and its addresses have to be maintained daily in
the record book for further reference.
\\ 
This project has been undertaken to automate the Cyber Cafe Management. One
entry should be made once and further the entries are fetched as required. This
makes the system more efficient. The user can only login the system if they are
authorized to do so.   \\
\\ \\
Cyber Cafe Management System‚Äù has been designed to exhibit the significant of an
automated system, which is used to manage and store information about Cyber Cafe
Management, using the facilities of C++.
The project begins with the separate different topics as menu bar items. Each
heading possesses a number of models as its menu items. The project provides a
user-friendly environment revealing the functioning of each part of Cafe Management
automating them, which the users are facing at different levels of management in any
Cyber Cafe. In this project sincere efforts have been made to develop a simple and
easy Computer Based Cyber Cafe Management. \\


\\
\\ \\ \\ \\
The user is provided with remarkable facilities of adding, printing, saving, deleting,
modifying, closing as well as editing the data that has been entered currently or in
the past.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \vspace{5mm}
    \large \item The basic task of our software is to provide operators and customers with an accurate timing and billing information at any time. Cyber cafe management system keeps customer accounts, so that customers can log in on their own using username and password
    \large \item The cyber cafe currently maintains the records manually. All the working hours, user names, and retain addresses daily in the record book for further reference. Due to the manual method, the processing is not up to the mark and prone to inefficiencies. Report generation is a very tedious and prone error procedure. 
    \large \item We created an OOP(Object Oriented Programming) based cyber cafe management System, which will automate the whole Cyber Cafe Management.
    \large \item Cyber Cafe Management System is a significant place for keeping member records as per I.T., And C++ with application development tools has made it relatively easier for computer professionals to build several projects.
    \large \item Our software's primary task is to provide operators and customers with accurate timing and billing information at any time. Cybercafe management system keeps customer accounts so that customers can log in on their account using username and password.This will also help reduce most time spending on their written records to know the total customers visited any day and calculate profit.
    \large \item One entry should be made once and further the entries are fetched as required. This makes the system more efficient. The user can only login the system if they are authorized to do so.
    \large \item  The users of this system are required to feed up their own data giving up appropriate constraints to be able to manipulate the functioning of various highlights of the system.
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section{Salient Features}
\vspace{5mm}
 \large \begin{itemize}
\item  Cyber Cafe Management System is dos Based Graphical software. 
\item  Being of its ease of access and interface, this system can be used by any
specialized or non-specialized users. 
\item Addition, deletion, modification of member records, machine records and surfing
records are easily maintained. 
\item  Reduce time, money and efforts of doing the work. 
\item  Provide better service and accurate information to the factory. 
\item  Provide fast retrieval of information. 
\item Restricts unauthorized persons from using important data. 
\item Different pricing strategies for specialized and non-specialized Users based on the Level of Membership they avail.
\item Deleting all the Customers History and Data after he/she completes his Session.
\item Special Privileges include Reduced Charges on System Usage to Premium Users who had taken a Membership in Cafe.
\end{itemize} \newpage
\section{Basic Implementation}
\vspace{2mm}
The Initial Startup Screen will ask for the Admin-User Credentials which will then redirect to the Main Menu because the Cafe Sessions are only allotted by the Admin.
\vspace{2mm}
The Main Screen contains 3 Options
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Master Entry
    \item Cafe Management
    \item Exit
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Master Entry :} This Contains all the Necessary Information of the Premium Members of the Cafe and all the Computer Details.
    Also the functions which are used to
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Add New Members
    \item Update Info
    \item Delete Info
    \item Membership Plan
    \item etc
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cafe Management : }This Contains the Whole Cafe Details like  the Non-premium/Premium Member Login/Logout Details and the Premium/Non-Premium Usage Charges.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Booking(Login/Logout)
        \item Charges
        
    \end{itemize}
    
    
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section{Code Implementation}
\vspace{3mm}
\noindent To implement this Design we require 3 Classes with various Member Functions
Classes include :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Member Entry
    \item Computer Entry
    \item Cyber Cafe
\end{itemize}
\vspace{3mm}
     \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Member Entry :}This Class include Various Member Functions and Data Members which involve creating Premium User Objects of Cyber Cafe using the concept of Inheritence.\\
        The Member Entry Consists of Various options:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Add New Member
            \item Display Members
            \item Update Record
            \item Delete Record
            \item Search Record
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Computer Entry :}This Class include Functions which deal with the performance of the Computers .\\
        The Computer Entry consists of Various options:
        \begin{itemize}
